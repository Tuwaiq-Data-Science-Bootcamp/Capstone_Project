2. Alanoud Alrashed (collect data and training model, website)
3. Rawan Alhalwan (collect data and training model, website)
## Introduction:
Arabic Sign Language recognition we create our data set of diffrent signs and each sign 30 photo taking, using OpenCV
also, trained some data for letters and predict the sign throug openCv.

## Proposed Algorithms:
RNN for words
