## About the Capstone Project:
The main objective behind this project is to use what you learn during the Bootcamp include all libraries and skills that you have gain. Moreover, to evaluate learning outcomes by applying main concepts using technologies related such as numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, plotly and scikit-learn.
applay Data Science LifeCycle and work as team members
mindset toolset

## Essential Requirements 📝
In capstone project we will wrappe up all skills that you have learn in the phases of Data Science LifeCycle.

### Phase#1: Bussiness Problem 💡
- You have to find an interesting question or problem and try to answer this question using data science techniques.

### Phase#2: Dataset 💽
- Pick a siutable dataset that helps you to find reasonable answers to your questions.
- Choose a real dataset that needs to clean and preprocess.
- The dataset should have at least 1000 records for Machine Learning Algorithms / 10,000 for Deep Learning Algorithms.
- Make sure that you are really understand your dataset.


### Phase#3: Data Analysis and Preprocessing (Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)) 🔎📊
- Apply the essential EDA steps: head, shape, info, describe, missing values.
- Draw at least 10 interactive charts that give an overview of your data.
- The charts should have a proper formatting includes XY-Axis lables and the main taitle.

### Phase#4: Data Modeling (Machine Learning) 🤖
- Choose three to five proper ML Algorithms.
- You have to propose your reasons behind your choices - the reasons must be based a trust resource.
- Use two splitting methods (train-test split and cross-validation split).

### Phase#5: Model Evauation 📐
- Report appropriate evaluation metrics for each model.
- Display the used techniques for accuracy enhancment
- Create a chart that compares the final results of your selected models.

### Phase#6: Model Deployment 🖥
- Convert your model to pkl formate
- Deploy your model on a website.

### Phase#7: Conclusion 🏁
- Write a final conclusion and recommendations (your interpretation of the results).
- Report your final conclusion and findings in one page (readme markdown file).


### Optional Requirements - Nice to Have 😍
- Create an interactive dashboard using plotly.

## Final Deliverables 📦
1. Notebook file(.ipynb).
2. Dataset file.
3. README.md file.
